This a (not so basic) build a burger app made by React.js with the help of Redux. This uses firebase to place all your delicious pixilated orders of burgers. 

## Features
In this burger builder you can build up a burger on the menu and it will be animated as you pick your ingredients. You just need to make an account to proceeed to the checkout to get your magnificent burger.

### Security Features
There are some extra features where I did my best to focus on creating a secure environment for this app. I've even added a few custom error messages and features to show that I'm serious!

## TODOS:

### Javascript
* Recreate this all with React hooks instead of using class based components.
* Add more information in orders such as delivery type picked
* Include more burger ingredients and the logic that follows with it all

### CSS
* See if I can add more custom css
* Make new burger ingredients with css
* Look into SASS

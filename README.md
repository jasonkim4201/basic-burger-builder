This a (not so basic) build a burger app made by React.js with the help of Redux. This uses firebase to place all your delicious pixilated orders of burgers.

### Security Features
There are some extra features where I did my best to focus on creating a secure environment for this app. I've even added a few custom error messages and features to show that I'm serious!
